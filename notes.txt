Terrain generation
    -   biome map: look at fast noise lite examples - cellular noise (return type cell value) with simplex domain warp independent
    -   rivers/tunnels: simplex, ping pong fractal type, low octaves, use aggressive spline to take a band of values. try different domain warps
    -   fractal types: RigidMulti makes spikey terrain, Billow makes sand-dune like terrain, Fbm makes more smooth terrain (looks similar to just summing layers)
